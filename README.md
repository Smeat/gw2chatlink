I originally planned to modify https://github.com/m10x/Gw2ChatCodeBuddy but as writing everything from scratch seemed like the faster method, I chose that route.

Only tested on Linux, but should work on other operating systems as well.

# Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# TODO
 * GUI (ncurses or proper gui)
 * Save to file
